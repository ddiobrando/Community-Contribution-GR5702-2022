For people working in Data Science field without statistical background, visualization using R might be unfamiliar to them. We hope this tutorial can help those people better use R. To achieve this goal, we summarized the most common used graphics both in Python and R. Users can have a look at difference of the effect and function of these graphics in Python and R clearly because we use the same datasets for the same types of graphic. We emphasizes on the advantages and disadvantages for both of them when dealing with different problems. 

These are the packages used for Python:
ggplot2; gridExtra; reshape2; dplyr; vcd; gcookbook; ggalluvial; MASS

These are the packages used for R:
Matplotlib; seaborn; numpy; pandas; sklearnl; holoviews

For details of our work, please see the attached pdf,ipynb and rmd files.

To sum up, both Python and R have useful packages used for plotting. By comparison, we think R visual ecosystem is relatively perfect. Its focus on statistics offers lots of convenience in applications. Python is a more general language and its visualization developed quickly in recent years.
